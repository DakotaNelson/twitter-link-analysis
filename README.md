# Twitter Link Analysis

Find out what links are shared most by your twitter followees (the people you follow). First, grabs a list of the people you follow, then uses the Twitter streaming API to return any Tweet from them that has a link in it. These tweets are then stored in a quick-n-dirty SQLite database for analysis. Also includes analysis code you can run to generate reports on what domains are the most shared.
